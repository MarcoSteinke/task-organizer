# Task Organizer:

## Introduction:

The "Task Organizer" is a project which which helps me in organizing tasks that I have to complete.
There are different categories of tasks which can be set. Thus it gives a nice overview of what is yet
to complete in the different categories. Tasks will be able to be shared between users in the future. Thus allowing
the management of tasks between small groups or pairs of users. Previous tasks will remain as templates for new tasks.
All tasks will be stored encrypted to maintain privacy.
